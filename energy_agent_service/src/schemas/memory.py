"""
Agent memory schema definitions.

This module provides Pydantic models for validating and serializing agent
memory data. The schemas define both the complete memory representation
(`Memory`) and a minimal version for persistence requests
(`MemorySave`).

Classes:
    Memory: Full schema representing agent memory with optional
        conversation, variable, and code contexts.
    MemorySave: Lightweight schema for persisting minimal memory
        metadata (user, session, file).
