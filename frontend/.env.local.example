# Mapbox Configuration
# Get your free Mapbox access token from: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/
# This is REQUIRED for proper map visualizations with px.scatter_mapbox
# Without it, maps may not display properly even with "open-street-map" style
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here

# Alternative: For testing without token, the frontend will attempt to use OpenStreetMap tiles
# But for production use, a valid Mapbox token is recommended
