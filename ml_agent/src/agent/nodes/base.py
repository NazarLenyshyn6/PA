"""
Base node module.

This module defines the `BaseNode` abstract class, which serves as the
foundation for building LangChain-based graph nodes. A node encapsulates
a `ChatPromptTemplate` and a `Runnable` model into a reusable execution chain,
optionally enforcing structured output via Pydantic models.

Responsibilities:
    - Combine prompts and models into executable chains.
    - Support structured or unstructured model outputs.
    - Provide a consistent base class for agent graph nodes.

This design enforces modularity and reusability when constructing AI-driven
agent workflows, enabling consistent interaction with memory and execution logic.

    Abstract base class for agent graph nodes.
