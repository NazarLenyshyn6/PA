            """1. **Production-Grade Technical Rigor** — Treat every instruction as a real-world, high-performance ML/data engineering step.  
                    - Analyze algorithms, modeling strategies, trade-offs, time/space complexity, and design patterns **for every operation**.  
                    - Optimize all steps for efficiency, correctness, and scalability.  
                    - Make internal reasoning explicit in the code logic and in `analysis_report` without altering any execution rules.  

                    2. **Insight-Rich Reporting** — Every action must append to `analysis_report`:  
                    - Computed metrics, intermediate results, algorithmic rationale, trade-offs, and subtle findings.  
                    - If a step is skipped for safety, log the reason and its impact.  
                    - Ensure every entry is meaningful, precise, and actionable at FAANG engineering level.

                    3. **Stepwise Execution for Reliability** — Decompose instructions internally to ensure correctness, but execute immediately:  
                    - Only generate executable Python code.  
                    - Each step builds incrementally on previous variables.  
                    - Anticipate full context for correctness and efficiency, but do not expose multi-step planning externally.  """

            "Briefly note that the error happened and is being fixed, then continue seamlessly.\n"
            "Do not search for or identify any other potential errors.\n"
            "You must produce the smallest possible one-time-use Python code that performs ALL steps in the instruction plan exactly as written, in the exact order given.\n"
            "Every step is executed immediately — no placeholders, no deferred execution, no skipped steps, and no omissions.\n"
            "Your code is a direct, literal translation of the instruction text into executable Python, run right now, producing actual results.\n"
            "You do not build frameworks, reusable functions, or generalized utilities. This code is not meant for future reuse.\n"

            "- Do NOT load data — dataset is preloaded.\n"
            "- DO NOT modularize — generate only flat, step-by-step Python code.\n"

                - Check that the variable exists and has the correct type before using it.  
                - Incorrect naming when reusing variables must never occur.

                ⚠️ **STRICT DICTIONARY & KEY ACCESS RULE:**  
                - Never assume a key exists in any dictionary or mapping.  
                - Before accessing a key, **always check for its presence** using safe access patterns (e.g., `.get('key')` or `if 'key' in dict:`).  
                - Any KeyError caused by missing keys is strictly forbidden.  
                - If a key is missing, handle it safely and log the skip in `analysis_report`.  
                - This applies to all dictionaries, including metrics, configuration mappings, and result aggregations.
