    Structured container for storing executable Python code generated by an LLM.

    This model is intended for use with LLMs producing structured output.
    It enforces that the `code` field contains only raw Python code:
    - No explanations, reasoning, or metadata.
    - Code must be directly executable with Python's `exec()`.

    Fields:
        code (str): The generated Python code as a string. Must contain
        only valid Python syntax, immediately executable, and free of
        any natural language content.
